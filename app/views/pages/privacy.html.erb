        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Protecting your private information is something we take very seriously. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to the website provided by Billion L3C (“Billion”) at www.billioneffect.com (the “Site”) and other products and services (“Products and Services”) offered by Billion and governs data collection and usage. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to Billion, Inc. include www.billioneffect.com and Billion. The Billion website is a crowdfunding platform. By using the Billion website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.</p>

        <h2>Collection of your Personal Information</h2>

If you purchase Billion's products and services, we collect billing and credit card information. This information is used to complete the purchase transaction. Billion may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your age, gender, household income, political affiliation, race and religion. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future.</p>

        <p>Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Billion. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, location, and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to enhance security, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Billion website. In order to provide its products and services, Billion may also share this information to third parties in anonymized and aggregate data sets, through the use of counting, sampling, averaging, or other statistical means to protect your individual identity.</p>

        <p>If you connect your Billion account to third party accounts, Billion may collect information from those accounts such as account number, username, or contacts.</p>

        <p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Billion's public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others.</p>

        <p>Billion encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Billion so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Billion is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Billion website.</p>

        <h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>

        <p>Billion collects and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and deliver the services you have requested.</p>

        <p>Billion may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Billion and its affiliates. Billion may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>

        <p>Billion may sell, rent, or lease customer information to third parties in order to offer you enhancements to the Products and Services, for advertising purposes, or to offer you third party products and services that may be of interest to you.</p>

        <p>Billion may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. Billion may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Billion, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>

        <p>Billion may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within Billion, in order to determine what Billion services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within Billion to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>

        <p>Billion will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Billion or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Billion; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Billion, or the public.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>

        <p>Billion may offer the ability for you to remove content and materials that you have previously submitted to the Products and Services. If you use these features, you acknowledge that such data may not be immediately erased, due to the mechanisms of the removal procedures or the use of backup copies.</p>

        <p>Please be aware that even if you use these features to remove information from your account or profile, copies of that information may remain elsewhere, to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users or systems.</p>

        <p>You acknowledge that discontinued use of the Products and Services does not imply that previously submitted content and materials are deleted from the systems that provide the Products and Services.</p>

        <p>We may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Products and Services or to comply with legal obligations.</p>

        <h2>Use of Cookies, Pixels and Other Technologies</h2>

        <p>The Billion website may use “cookies”, “pixels”, and other similar technologies such as local storage and caching, for authentication, to enhance security, to help you personalize your online experience, for advertising, and for performance, analytics and research. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

        <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Billion pages, or register with Billion products or services, a cookie helps Billion to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Billion website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Billion features that you customized.</p>

        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Billion services or websites you visit.</p>

        <p>A pixel (also known as page tags or web beacons) is a small image or piece of code embedded in a web page, email, or similar medium, that allows for analytics, such as whether a user has viewed an email.</p>

        <p>Local storage and caching are technologies similar to cookies that allow for the storage of small amounts of data in your browser, in order to facilitate faster or more personalized experiences on subsequent visits.</p>

        <p>We may also use third party products and services that use these technologies in order to provide advertising, collect analytics about the usage of our products and services, to measure and improve performance, and for other purposes.</p>

        <h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>

        <p>To secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, Billion uses industry standard technologies such as encryption and access controls to servers.</p>

        <p>When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

        <p>When your information is shared with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, your data is secured according to those third party’s privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Children Under Thirteen

        <p>Billion does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If you are under the age of thirteen, you must ask your parent or guardian for permission to use this website.</p>

        <h2>Disconnecting your Billion Account from Third Party Websites</h2>

BY CONNECTING YOUR Billion ACCOUNT TO YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE CONTINUOUS RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO OTHERS (IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS ON THOSE THIRD PARTY SITES).
